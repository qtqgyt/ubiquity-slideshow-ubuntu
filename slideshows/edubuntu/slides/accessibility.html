	<li><!-- "your" refers to a large group that includes the reader. -->We want to make computers work for everyone, whatever your physical circumstances. So, we provide tools that make Edubuntu one of the most accessible operating systems around.</li>  
	<li><!-- The string "Accessibility Preferences" is describing a particular item: Settings > Accessibility, and the string "System menu" describes that section of the main menu. Note that certain words are kept the same to make the menu items discoverable. It is intentional that we are using soft descriptions instead of mapping out a rigid path for the user to follow. Please, if it is natural for your locale, consider the same convention. -->You can get at these tools in one place: the <em>Accessibility Preferences</em>, inside the System Settings. From there, you can turn on helpful tools like the <em>Screen Reader</em>, to speak text on the screen, or Hover Click to press mouse buttons automatically.</li>
	<li><!-- As before, the string "Appearance Settings" is describing a particular item: Settings > Appearance. Certain words were kept the same to make the item discoverable. -->Remember to check out the <em>Appearance Settings</em>, too. You can choose between dark and light styles, change the background, and even change the accent color.</li>
